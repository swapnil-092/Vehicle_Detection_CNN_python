## Problem Description
This project aims to solve the problem of vehicle detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify vehicles in images. The model can be used for various applications such as traffic monitoring, autonomous vehicles, and surveillance systems.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found at [Kaggle: Vehicle Detection Image Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/vehicle-detection-image-set). It consists of a collection of images with labeled vehicle and non-vehicle classes.

## Libraries and Tech Stack
The following libraries and technologies are used in this project:
- Python: Programming language used for development
- Keras: Deep learning library used for building and training the CNN model
- TensorFlow: Backend framework for Keras
- OpenCV: Computer vision library used for image preprocessing and resizing
- scikit-learn: Library for data splitting and evaluation metrics
- Matplotlib: Plotting library used for visualizing training results

## Results
Here we find that the model works quite well with accuracy of **99.27%** on training dataset and **97.07%** on test dataset.Thus this model is apt to identify the vehicles.

## Conclusion
After running the code, the final result is the accuracy achieved by the model on the test set. The accuracy metric indicates how well the model can classify vehicle and non-vehicle images. Higher accuracy values suggest better performance.
